as well as Muslims of the Indian subcontinent have greatly appreciated his spiritual legacy for the past seven centuries.
His poems have been widely translated into many of the world's languages and transposed into various formats.

<i>He is most commonly called Rumi in English.</i> His full name is given by his contemporary Sipahsalar as Muhammad bin Muhammad bin al-Husayn al-Khatibi al-Balkhi al-Bakri 
.He is more commonly known as Jalal ad-Din Mu?ammad Rumi.
Jalal ad-Din is an Arabic name meaning "Glory of the Faith". Balkhi and Rumi are his nisbas, meaning, respectively,
"from Balkh" and "from Rûm" <small>('Roman,' what European history now calls Byzantine Anatolia)</small>. According to the authoritative Rumi biographer Franklin Lewis of the 
University of Chicago, "the Anatolian peninsula which had belonged to the Byzantine, or eastern Roman empire, 
had only relatively recently been conquered by Muslims and even when it came to be controlled by Turkish Muslim rulers, 
it was still known to Arabs, Persians and Turks as the geographical area of Rum. As such, there are a number of historical personages born in or 
associated with Anatolia known as Rumi, a word borrowed from Arabic literally meaning 'Roman,' in which context Roman refers to subjects of the Byzantine 
Empire or simply to people living in or things associated with Anatolia."He was also known as <sub>"Mullah of Rum"</sub>.
He is widely known by the sobriquet Mawlana/Molana in Iran and popularly known as Mevlânâ in<sup> Turkey</sup>. 
Mawlana is a term of <u>Arabic origin</u>, meaning "our master".
The term Mawlawi/Mowlavi (Persian) and Mevlevi (Turkish), also of Arabic origin, meaning "my master", is also frequently used for him.</p>
